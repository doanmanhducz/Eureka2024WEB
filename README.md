## Introduction: WEBSITE PHISHCATCHER - An ecosystem for combating online fraud, including Voice Phishing, Mail Phishing, Phone Number Phishing, and other anti-fraud utilities.

We developed the PhishCatcher ecosystem to detect phishing websites, emails, and voice scams using Artificial Intelligence and multimodal models. PhishCatcher leverages deep learning models to automatically extract features from various sources, including website DOM structures, domain names, and other attributes. The system delivers high performance in detecting zero-day threats and countering adversarial attacks through multidimensional analysis, eliminating reliance on a single detection factor.

PhishCatcher is not only effective in detecting phishing attempts across websites, emails, and voice-based scams but also plays a crucial role in protecting users from cyberattacks. By integrating AI-powered multimodal detection with AWG, the system can respond swiftly and efficiently, mitigating potential damages before they occur. As a result, PhishCatcher contributes to a safer online environment, minimizing risks and enhancing cybersecurity for users in the digital world.

### PHISHCATCHER:
- Model Check Vishing: When a phishing audio recording is input, the deep learning model utilizing CNNs will analyze and determine whether the recording is fraudulent or not. <br>
